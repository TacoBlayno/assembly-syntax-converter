# Assembly Syntax Converter
This repository is meant to be a code base for converting AT&amp;T assembly syntax to Intel assembly syntax and vice versa.

## Repository Goals
This repository aims to convert between AT&T and Intel Assembly syntaxes. It also aims to be programmed in such a way that it is reasonably easy to add other syntax conversions. It aims to achieve maximum portablility by taking advantage of web browser portability.
